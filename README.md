This is an socket application to make a chat messenger using Tkinter as GUI
This will work properly with computers connected to the same network , however to chat with other people on different network , find you ipv6 address , paste it in the HOST and where it's emntioned right after the line as AF_INET , use AFINET6 as you are using an ipv6
you can also try piv4 , but for some reason it didn't work in my case , maybe beacuse of some sort of firewall.
Thank you
